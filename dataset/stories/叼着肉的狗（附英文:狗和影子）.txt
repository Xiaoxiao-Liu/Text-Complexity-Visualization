狗叼着肉渡过一条河。他看见水中自己的倒影，还以为是另一条狗叼着一块更大的肉。想到这里，他决定要去抢那块更大的肉。于是，他扑到水中抢那块更大的。结果，他两块肉都没得到，水中那块本来就不存在，原有那块又被河水冲走了。 这篇寓言的本意是戒贪得，但是我们现在可以应用到旁的方面。据说每个人需要一面镜子，可以常常自照，知道自己是个什么东西。不过，能自知的人根本不用照镜子；不自知的东西，照了镜子也没有用——譬如这只衔肉的狗，照镜以后，反害他大叫大闹，空把自己的影子，当作攻击狂吠的对象。可见有些东西最好不要对镜自照。--------------------------狗和影子(The Dog and the Shadow） It happened that a Dog had got a piece of meat and was carrying it home in his mouth to eat it in peace. Now, on his way home he had to cross a plank lying across a running brook. As he crossed, he looked down and saw his own shadow reflected in the water beneath. Thinking it was another dog with another piece of meat, he made up his mind to have that also. So he made a snap at the shadow in the water, but as he opened his mouth the piece of meat fell out, dropped into the water and was never seen more. Beware lest you lose the substance by grasping at the shadow.
